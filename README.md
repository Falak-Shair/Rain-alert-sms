# Rain-alert-sms
With the Help of this project I have learned all about API keys, authentication, environment variables, and also how to send SMS using Python.

I have used API like Twilio to send SMS messages to ourselves so that we can get an alert whenever rain is expected.One other API I have 
used from Openweather to fetch weather data. This program will collect 12 hours weather data and send Alert SMS i.e "It's going to rain today, Remember to bring an umbrella."
